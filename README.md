# Personalized Image Captioning with Transformer Models

This project is a work in progress. The aim is to implement an image captioning system using transformer-based models like BERT or GPT. The system will automatically generate personalized captions for photos. The model will be trained to produce descriptive captions that capture the essence, context, and relevant details depicted in the photos, tailored to specific themes or topics.

## Objective

Implement an image captioning system using transformer-based models like BERT or GPT to automatically generate personalized captions for photos. Train the model to produce descriptive captions that capture the essence, context, and relevant details depicted in the photos, tailored to specific themes or topics.

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the principles of image captioning and its applications in generating personalized content for social media platforms.
2. Gain familiarity with deep learning models for image captioning, including encoder-decoder architectures with attention mechanisms.
3. Learn techniques for preprocessing image and text data, including tokenization, numerical representation, and data augmentation.
4. Develop skills in model selection, training, and evaluation for image captioning tasks, with a focus on fine-tuning pre-trained models for specific domains.
5. Explore methods for deploying and integrating the captioning model into social media workflows for automatic caption generation.

Stay tuned for more updates as the project progresses.
